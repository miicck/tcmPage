                I have been known to do some work occasionally, here is some of it:
                <h1>Variational quantum monte carlo code</h1>
                I am the author of a simple variational quantum monte carlo (VQMC) code which can be found <a href=https://github.com/miicck/vqmc class=inline>here</a>.
                A summary of VQMC and some results obtained using this code can be found <a href=pdfs/vqmc.pdf class=inline>here</a>. The code can be used to construct a multi-electron
                wavefunction from atomic basis sets, and calculate the resulting variational energy in the presence of nucleii of your choosing. It will automatically
                enforce the correct exchange symmetry via a slater determinant and attempt to recover some of the correlation energy using a Jastrow factor. It works quite well for atomic
                and small molecular systems. Monte carlo is very easy to parallelise so there is a parallel branch (using MPI), as well as a serial version.

                <h1>Masters dissertation</h1>
                I did a masters degree at Oxford before my PhD. My masters was broadly in the area of quantum computing, and my dissertation was on photon induced dechoerence of
                superconducting charge qubits. It can be found <a href=pdfs/masters.pdf class=inline>here</a>.

                <h1>Rutherford Appleton Labs</h1>
                In the summer of 2016 I interned at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Labs particle physics department. Whilst there I designed, implemented and tested several algorithms
                for interaction vertex reconstruc-tion intended for the proposed 2025 upgrade of the CMS detector at CERN. A report on these is available
                <a href=pdfs/ral.pdf class=inline>here</a>. Whilst there I also wrote a user guide on the DELPHES detector modelling software which can be found
                <a href=pdfs/delphes.pdf class=inline>here</a>.

                <h1>Utilities</h1>
                Some web-based math utilities that I've written can be found <a href=utilities.html class=inline>here</a>.
